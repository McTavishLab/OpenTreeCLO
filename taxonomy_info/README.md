Notes on reconcillaition:

Adding new taxa for spp in new_in_2021.txt


Issues:


Gallinago magellanica can;t map or add bc
Exists but is supressed:
https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/taxonomy/browse?id=5560024



Want to add Taenioptynx sylvaticus
    But genus (e.g. Taenioptynx) needs to propogate before spp can be mapped, I think.



Added but should remove:

6520370 is same taxon as 723333
